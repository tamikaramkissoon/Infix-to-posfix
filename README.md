## Overview
The conversion of infix to postfix is extremely importance to machines since a machine cannot differentiate the operators and parenthesis easily. The infix to postfix program uses the C++ language to perform the conversion of infix expression to postfix expression and evaluate the expressions based on BODMAS.

--- 

## Description
* The program reads an infix expression from a file and prints the expression to the console.
* The infix expression is then converted to its postfix equivalent and printed to the console.
* The postfix expression is then evaluated and displayed
* If there is an unbalanced parentheses in the expression a error message is printed to the console.
